Ever fancied tweeting with **bold**, _italics_ or ~~strikethrough~~ text?

Twitter may not support it but you **can**.

Write in markdown and grab your fancy text.

###### _Note: The generated bold, italics and strikethrough texts are [UTF Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols). So if you run them by a screen reader, you'll find that the reader reads them out by their symbol name. But then, all screen readers struggle reading smileys too (ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸ¦„ðŸ˜Ž) and that doesn't stop us from using smileys._
